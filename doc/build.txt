KISS 3rd Party Software:
	Qt
	QScintilla
	GLFW
	GLee

Qt and QScintilla must be installed on your computer.  Installing these packages is simple, but slightly different on each platform. 

Qt can be found at http://www.trolltech.com
QScintilla can be found at http://riverbankcomputing.co.uk

GLFW and GLee binaries are included in the source package for convenience, as well as sources.

To build KISS, run the following commands:

cd ${KISS-SOURCE-DIR}
qmake
make
make install

After these commands are run, there should be a new directory in the KISS root directory named 'deployment'.  This directory will contain the KISS binary along with the current stable targets.  Have fun, and good luck!
